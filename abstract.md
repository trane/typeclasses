# Abstract

Scala as an Object-Functional language has an almost endless supply of options
to tackle the day-to-day problems that we run into as developers. However, it's
often not clear when to choose one option over another. Type-classes provide a
simple solution to several problem spaces -- often filling the gaps that other
traditional solutions fail to fill.

# Description

In my talk, I will iterate over a real-world problem using common tools made
available by Scala to help gain some intuition about how type-classes work and
why they are useful. Most importantly, since type-classes can be used to
completely replace entire features of the Scala language, I give some concrete
examples of pragmatic use-cases to show some insight into where and when to
apply type-classes to day-to-day problems.
